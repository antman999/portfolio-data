Hey, I'm Anthony and welcome to my Blog!

A little about me, I previously worked as a Frontend Engineer at **Twitter**, where I was part of the **Web UI team**. I focused on building customer-facing UI and served as an owner of our design systems library that powered **Twitter.com**, **Tweetdeck**, **Embedded Tweets**, and other client-side facing applications.

I'm deeply passionate about the ever-evolving world of web development, constantly exploring new front-end technologies and immersing myself in building clean, intuitive, and accessible user interfaces. Currently i'm diving a lot more into backend development and building out a Travel Planner that allows you to share and create itineraries with friends and family.

Beyond the endless quest of creating and fixing bugs ğŸ˜…, I love practicing Muay Thai and especially Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. It's a discipline that, much like coding, requires a problem-solving mindset and strategic thinking. The parallels between the two are fascinating, as both involve navigating complexities and finding creative solutions.

Most Importanly what I love the most is spending time with my dog cocoa (she is a dachshund mix) who acts as part time parkour athlete jumping off everything she shouldn't.
