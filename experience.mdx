## About Me

Thank you for visiting my portfolio site! A little about me, I'm a software engineer based in NYC with previous experience at Twitter. My journey began at Flatiron Bootcamp, where I immersed myself in the world of web development and gained a solid foundation in the fundamentals.

Before attending Flatiron, I was pursuing a degree in Computer Science while working in the banking industry. However, when I'm not busy with work, I love exploring new front-end technologies, practicing Muay Thai and BJJ, and most importantly being a dog dad to Cocoa üê∂.
