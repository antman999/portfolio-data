## About Me

Thank you for visiting my portfolio site! A little about me, I'm a software engineer based in NYC with previous experience at Twitter. My journey began at Flatiron Bootcamp, where I immersed myself in the world of web development and gained a solid foundation in the fundamentals.

Before attending Flatiron, I was pursuing a degree in Computer Science while working in the banking industry. However, when I'm not busy with work, I love exploring new front-end technologies, practicing Muay Thai and BJJ, and most importantly being a dog dad to Cocoa üê∂.

## Work

#### Twitter

<small>**SWE I, 01/22 - 02/23, NYC**</small>

- One of the owners of the design system library that powered customer facing components on Twitter.com
- Provided on-call support for 160+ web engineers.
- Worked closely with other owners and stakeholders to address pain-points and improve developer experience and velocity.
- Upgraded Twitter.com and seven adjacent codebases from [React Native Web](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web) [0.16](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web/releases/tag/0.17.0) to [0.18](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web/releases/tag/0.18.0).
  - Collaborated with external teams for a smooth transition.
  - Resolved migration issues, improving performance and accessibility by 2%.
- drove a navigation headers redesign for Twitter web.

  - Enhanced visual consistency and improved the user experience. By aligning the web UI with mobile clients, we introduced a subtle blur animation to every header on Twitter.com. This change not only improved visual consistency but also significantly reduced visual fatigue for users. Additionally, it increased the viewing space for web users by 10%.
    The redesign was successfully implemented across the entire web user base following positive experimentation. Throughout the project, I collaborated with cross-functional teams to ensure a successful launch and integration, proactively addressing potential edge cases.

- Revamped Search Bars for Twitter.com.

- Automated props documentation in our design systems library (alongside tech lead).
  - Developed an internal tool similar to [react-docgen](https://github.com/reactjs/react-docgen), increasing developer velocity by 30%.
  - Utilized AST scripts to scrape components for key information.
